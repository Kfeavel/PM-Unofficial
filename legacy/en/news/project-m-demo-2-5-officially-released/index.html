<p>We are absolutely thrilled to announce that Project M Demo 2.5 has finally been released and is ready to be downloaded!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><h1><b><a href="/en/download">Project M Demo 2.5 Download</a></b></h1></center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Be sure to follow the step-by-step instructions to ensure everything works for you. Our latest installment comes with four additional characters, a handful of new features, several engine optimizations, plenty of aesthetic polish, and an extravaganza of character tweaks. See the compiled list of new content below:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><h1><u>Additional Characters!</u></h1></center><br />
<center><a href="/en/characters/ivysaur"><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/ivy-00.png" class="grid inline" /></a><a href="/en/characters/squirtle"><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/squirt-00.jpg" class="grid inline" /></a><br />
<a href="/en/characters/zero-suit-samus"><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/zss-00.png" class="grid inline" /></a><a href="/en/characters/diddy-kong"><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/ddk-00.jpg" class="grid inline" /></a></center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>These characters have been carefully designed and tweaked to ensure everyone has a blast playing with this batch of newcomers! Each of them has received a multitude of changes from Brawl to allow them to feel at home in Project M's environment, as well as received many unique new features! Ivysaur sports new Seed Bomb and Solarbeam attacks along with a plethora of healing moves and a new solar-powered system, while Squirtle slides into the scene with a new Bubble attack to pop his opponents into place! Zero Suit Samus dives into Project M with amazing mobility and her new Flipjump options while Diddy Kong leaps into the fray with his quirky banana play and a dash attack able to roll off ledges. These four new characters are just the tip of the iceberg with what is to come with Demo 2.5!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><h1><u>Engine Optimizations!</u></h1></center></p>

<p><br /></p>

</center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As you've come to expect from the previous two demos released, engine improvements have upgraded the game to become much better than its predecessor. Demo 2.5 follows this tradition, as it brings some significant optimizations to the engine at large. These fixes impact how you recover, the feel of combos, and the overall feel of the entire game! Melee veterans and casual newcomers alike will both be able to feel the difference in their gameplay quite naturally.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><h1><u>Brand New Features!</u></h1></center><br />
<center><br />

</center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Demo 2.5 introduces quite a few new features never seen before in a Smash Bros. game! Giving the player the ability to adjust stocks individually with a built-in crew-battle mode to keep track of the winner's stock for the next round. Need help to adjust to Project M's engine? Turn on Input Assistance to help get your feet wet! Ever wanted to get into a tournament set faster without all the hassle? Crossing out stages from the Stage Select Screen helps you do this easily! All of these new features just add to the overall package of this new release.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><h1><u>Aesthetic Polishes!</u></h1></center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><br />
<img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/Aesthetics2-02.png" /><br />
</center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Project M needed its own identity in other ways. Pokemon Stadium 2 with the Master Ball is but one example of how Project M distinguishes itself from Brawl. Bland and redundant recolors plaguing characters were chosen to be replaced in favor of more bright and apparent recolors for team and non-team colors! But that's not the only thing left here. There's also a new Stage Select Screen designed to allow players to pick from their favorite stages within seconds. All these aesthetic touch-ups only add to the experience, signifying that you are truly playing a new game!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><h1><u>Improved Character Design!</u></h1></center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><center><br />

</center></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>One of the last but most important features about this new release is the improved design changes to our cast of characters. After several months of tournament play and player feedback with Demo 2.1, the PMBR took careful steps to adjust characters in either small or big ways. Whether to redesign a character, or to apply small adjustments to their kit, there is no character that hasn't been touched in this release!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It's been well over two months since we announced Demo 2.5. Tired as we are, it feels like a major accomplishment for us to have another release out the door. The amount of work put into this release cannot be stated in only a few words. We hope that you will enjoy Demo 2.5 and support us in our continued effort to make the best Super Smash Bros. game possible. Thank you for being so patient with us and we hope you enjoy what is to come in Project M Demo 2.5!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Best Regards,<br />
-The PMBR</p>
