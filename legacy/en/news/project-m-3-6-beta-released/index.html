				<p>Hello Smashers,<br /><br />PMDev again, and this time we will be talking about the version we have just released and this time we’re bringing up why we chose to label this release as a beta. You heard right. Beta or not, 3.6 is here!<br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fJq_vfzvDi8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br />If you are familiar with our release structure in the past, we have always released our versions as final. However, sometimes bugs are discovered by the much larger base of playtesters that is you, the public. Upon fixing said bugs, we traditionally release a new patched version sometime after (2.5 and 2.5b by our older naming conventions or 3.0, 3.01 and 3.02). Knowing our limitations and understanding how important your role as players are, we have named this release the 3.6 Open Beta. Only after we are confident that it is completely ready, a final update will be released simply labeled 3.6.<br /><br />While we have performed months of extensive testing and bug fixing, we know there is always the chance bugs slip through the cracks that our small number of voluntary playtesters may have missed. As the name implies, there are no restrictions to play the open beta. When you are ready (and we know you are) head over to our <a href="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/en/download">download page here!</a> If you desire to assist the team with bug fixing for 3.6, please report any bugs you may find in the <a href="http://smashboards.com/forums/bug-reporting.362/">Bug Reporting forum on Smashboards.</a><br /><br />With the 3.6 beta comes a plethora of new features! Bowser's Castle is finally making its grand debut, but beware the thwomps! Beautiful remakes of classics like Peach's Castle and Saffron City make their way to the stage selection screen. Speaking of the stage selection screen, the new alternate stage loader brings back all the Brawl stages and allows for the highest number of playable stages ever in Project M. Several new costumes will be available to players, from Kart ROB to Dark Suit Samus. The audio team really put their creative caps on and produced some brand new music, sound effects, and a new announcer to enjoy whilst beating each other to a pulp. New aesthetics aplenty are coming with 3.6. Characters like Mewtwo and Pit have never looked so refined. In fact, the entire cast got a beauty boost! Along with 3.6 comes the most balanced cast Project M has ever had. Cast balancing was a major point of emphasis for us, and it certainly shows in 3.6. New modes have been added as well, as seen in the video. The new option, Auto-L cancel, is here! Finally, just as Bowser may take on an evolution to become Giga-Bowser, the wafty-man Wario dons his own super-suit to become Wario-Man! With some barbaric speed and combo potential he will surely liven (and stink up) any play session! For a list of all of the changes made, please see the <a href="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/en/news/project-m-3-6-changelist">change notes right here!</a><br /><br />As mentioned in our previous blog post, Development Team applications will be opening back up! However, the application process will be undergoing some changes. More details will be provided at a later date. To clarify, applications aren't open quite yet, but ideally will be soon. We are very eager to see what kinds of talented individuals wish to join the team as we press on into Project M's bright future.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience, your support, and your drive to play Project M. There is nothing more motivating than seeing fans share the same passion we do.<br /><br /><br />-- The PMDev team</p>
