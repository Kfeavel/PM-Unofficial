				<p>Another update for you from the Project M Development Team! We've been working hard on our next public release, and we'd like to talk with you about our design philosophy for Project M version 3.5.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As we have previously mentioned, we are aiming to tighten up the game to meet our project's design goals. In general, we are aiming to increase the depth of the game, while retaining the accessibility that the Smash Bros. series is well regarded for. At the moment, we believe our cast to possess tools that are a little too excessive in terms of flexibility, recovery prowess, punishment and more. This means that we are going through the cast and toning down tools and/or traits that may be seen as superfluous or detract from the game's complexity.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Our goal is to provide the player with enough tools to create a highly nuanced and effective playstyle, while providing opponents enough counterplay to punish mistakes to a high degree, necessitating thoughtful, challenging and engaging interactions with each other. We want to make sure that with skill, control, knowledge and creativity, a player can achieve phenomenal results and feel well rewarded as a result.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To provide you with an insight of the methodology we have been using, here is a general list of criteria that we are using in our cast-wide overview:<br /></p>

<ul class="bulletlist">
<li>Revising moves with static knockback curves and making them scale more with percentage. This is intended to create a much more dynamic combo game that requires knowledge of percentages, fall speed/weight, stage positioning etc. and allows a player to develop with more time, knowledge and experience of the game.</li>
<li>Balancing cooldowns with power/start-up/duration/utility.</li>
<li>Tools that mitigate positional advantage (e.g. circumventing juggles, edge guards).</li>
<li>Tools that provide excessive burst movement without appropriate risk.</li>
<li>Moves that hit at unintuitive angles.</li>
<li>Moves with SDI/hit-lag multipliers on them that circumvent the strength of Directional Influence (barring grounded multi-hit moves).</li>
<li>Recovery potency (as previously described in our earlier blogposts).</li>
</ul>

<p><br />Note that while these are general guidelines, expect some leeway to be made while considering what makes something acceptable.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As previously mentioned with our recovery blogpost, please note that this stems from design, and not necessarily balance. Our overview of the cast is a global one, and characters will receive due consideration regardless of current perceptions of their viability. As such, it is important to consider your character's changes within the scope of our goals for version 3.5, as opposed to viewing their changes in a 3.02 vacuum.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>We are pleased with how 3.5 is shaping up and are very excited for its release!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There is more for us to share soon!<br />
