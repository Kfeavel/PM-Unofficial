				<p>Hey everyone, we're hoping you’re enjoying the Art Team's announcements lately, who recently <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectMGame/status/496770118756864001">unveiled Shogun Dedede</a> on Tuesday. On Sunday we put out a blogpost going over some of our design goals for our next version, targeting recoveries. Today we'd like to go over a specific type of recovery: tethers. This blogpost, similar to the last one, will be competitively oriented, so to our more relaxed friends, please bear with us as we hope to have some shiny new content for the next version ready to announce soon.<br /><br />
Coupled with a general feeling of recoveries being too strong, we've determined that tethers especially are too strong as they are now to mesh with our project goals. Originally when <a href="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/en/news/project-m-blog-post-8">designing the tether mechanics back in 2011</a>, we were looking at how they functioned in Brawl when deciding what to do. It generally left a bad taste in players' mouths when tethers completely failed to latch to an occupied ledge (particularly with the increased ledge occupancy duration in Project M), so we decided to allow them to still tether when the edge is hogged. <br />
<center><br />
<img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/blogpost8-03small.jpg" /><br />
</center><br />We designed counterplay for the edgeguarder to employ: if the edge is hogged, the tetherer is forced into a somewhat laggy ledge jump animation that is punishable. We received a lot of praise for this but as time went on and tether characters were used, we eventually learned that the counterplay was simply not enough. To avoid being hogged, tether players can tether drop and retether up to 3 times in order to wait out a player on the ledge, and those with Z-Tethers can ledgedrop into an Up-Special to hit the opponent. Overall, most tether characters had powerful options to threaten the intended counterplay to tethers, which made properly punishing them dangerous and often not worth the risk. When risk vs. reward assessments favor non-interaction, we feel the need to step in.</p>

<p><center><br />
<img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/tethers1.jpg" /><br />
</center><br />In the spirit of making recoveries generally weaker, we're currently testing the following changes to tethers:<br />
<br /></p>

<p><ul class="numberlist"><li>Z-tethers only work once per air time. Special tethers (such as Zero Suit Samus's tethers) work twice per airtime. The harsher restriction on Z-tethers is offset by the ability to perform an Air Dodge before tethering as well as the option to use a traditional Up-Special recovery.</li><br />
<li>The forced hop is now quite laggy, a 50 frame animation (that’s fast-fallable to land quicker depending on the character's falling speed) that goes into a 30 frame specialfall-landlag animation upon landing. This hop does allow some horizontal drift control, so the tetherer can attempt to go back to the ledge, but the aerial drift they are allowed is lower than normal.</li></ul><br />This isn't set in stone and we're certainly receptive to feedback from the competitive community. However, in our own testing, we've found this to be reasonably punishable and meets our standards for recovery changes going into the next version. Characters with tethers that have particularly strong recoveries might see changes on top of these, as well. <br />
<center><br />
<img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com/content/images/news/tethers2.jpg" /><br />
</center><br />Stay tuned tomorrow, as we will be evaluating a character's recovery in-depth. We hope to describe what changes you can expect for that character's recovery for the next version, and get an insight on our development process going into 3.5.<br /><br />
See you tomorrow,<br />
