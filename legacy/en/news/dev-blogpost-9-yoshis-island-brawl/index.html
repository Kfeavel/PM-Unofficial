The Shy Guys bring good news! They come in peace!<br /><br />
Today we’d like to go over some changes that we’ve made to a common tournament stage. Yoshi’s Island Brawl has been deemed somewhat controversial in terms of legality due to Shy Guys, odd interactions with ledges, and of course, the Support Ghosts. All of these issues have been addressed in 3.5.<br /><br />
The Shy Guys played a big part in crippling one character's recovery in particular: Ness. It was an unfortunately common scenario for Ness to attempt to recover only for a Shy Guy to swoop in and eat his PK Thunder (thus causing him to plummet to his doom). This matchup-skewing disadvantage something we believe to be unacceptable for competitive play. To fix this, we have changed Ness’s PK Thunder so that it passes through stage hurtboxes rather than disappearing on-hit. In other words, when PK Thunder hits a Shy Guy or Smashville’s balloon, it will continue on in a fashion similar to Lucas. This change only applies to stage hurtboxes, so upon hitting another fighter, PK Thunder will terminate as normal. We feel these new mechanics are a welcome change that will virtually eliminate Ness’s unfortunate self-destructs on Yoshi’s Island as well as Smashville.<br /><br />

<br /></p>

<p>The next issue we’d like to address is the stage’s ledges. As you may know, some characters have a tendency of slipping off the ledge of the stage using certain attacks – a notable example being Wolf’s F-Smash. While the reason for this was initially attributed to the slanted ledges, the actual cause was a recently addressed stage collision quirk. While the stage’s ledges remain slanted, they now behave like all of the other ledges in the game. This means that players will not have to worry about certain moves slipping off the edge anymore.<br /><br />
The final, and probably most controversial, topic that we’d like to address are the Support Ghosts. In 3.02, these Ghosts appear at random intervals. This can be game changing because the Ghosts can pop up and rescue a player’s seemingly lost stock. In 3.5, the Ghosts are no longer random. They now appear approximately every 25 seconds, with each Ghost appearing 15 seconds after the previous one.<br /><br />
Even with the new, consistent timing of the Support Ghost platforms, we felt that this didn't do quite enough to eliminate the random factor they introduced. This is where the new White Shy Guys come in. For those of you unfamiliar with Yoshi's Story, White Shy Guys help you by rescuing any Yoshi you may have lost in previous levels. Now, they are here in Project M to warn you that a platform is going to appear. They sure are helpful little guys!<br /><br />

<br /></p>

<p>We feel these changes will help this stage to retain its unique identity without sacrificing its competitive value.<br />
<br /><br />
Stay tuned for more stage-related info and we hope you enjoy Yoshi's Island Brawl in 3.5!<br />
