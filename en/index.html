		Hello once again friends. This post is nothing major and is simply a fun cosmetic change to the Project M 3.6 strap screen. The only difference you'll notice is that the URL has changed from "http://projectmgame.com" to "https://pmunofficial.com". Enjoy!<br/><br/>

    <p>Hello and welcome to the Project M 3.6 changelist! This is an extensive (but potentially not complete) log documenting the changes between Project M 3.5 and Project M 3.6. As usual, we prioritized getting the changelist out right when the version released, so in some cases it may not be 100% correct or formatted nicely. Please understand that these changelogs were compiled by different people, and as such they may be worded differently. If we notice something is off we'll try to come back and fix it. This changelist combines both the Project M 3.6 Beta and Project M 3.6 Full versions, so if you've already read the previous changelist, <span class="change_highlight">we've highlighted what's different in blue.</span><br />
<br />With that out of the way, we're going to be using some technical terms that the community at large may not understand. To help with this changelog's effectiveness, we'll be defining these terms below.<br />
<br />DMG = Damage.<br />KB = Knockback<br />KBG = Knockback Growth. This value determines how quickly a hitbox's KB scales with the opponents percent. Damage is also a major factor in determining scaling.<br />BKB = Base Knockback. This amount of KB is added to the end result of the knockback formula and is most noticeable a low percents.<br />WDSK = Weight Dependent Set Knockback. As the name impies, this is a type of KB that is set and does not scale with percent, and instead has a set amount that varies only based on the opponents weight. KBG in this instance is used as a multiplier, but is usually set at 100.<br />IASA = Interruptible As Soon As. This is a long-standing term in competitive Smash that refers to the first frame that a character can interrupt an attack, often before the full animation has completed visually. Generally this will be used to describe endlag increases and decreases.<br />Hitlag = The amount of freeze frames a character goes into when hit by a hitbox. This term will usually be used to describe a multiplier that increases or decreases the amount of hitlag that a hitbox would normally induce.<br />SDI = Smash DI, the ability for a player to move around while in Hitlag based on control stick input. This term will usually be used to describe a multiplier that increases or decreases the effectiveness of SDIing an attack.<br />Angle/Trajectory = This describes the angle at which an opponent is sent flying after being hit by a hitbox. 90 is straight up, while 0 is a purely horizontal trajectory.<br />
361 angle = This angle is used throughout the game as a dynamic replacement to what would otherwise be 45, the go-to "horizontal attack" angle. This angle starts off sending further horizontally than 45 at lower KBs, but quickly scales up to 45 in-game. For all intents and purposes you can imagine the trajectory as simply being 45.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Now that we've explained those terms, here's the changelog!<br />
