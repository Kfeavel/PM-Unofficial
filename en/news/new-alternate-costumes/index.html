				<p>My name is Nanobuds, and I am one of the modelers for Project M. I help rig the models to their base skeletons, and import them into the game. I am also the one who has been putting together the Samus costumes for the next release.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After 3.0 was released, we listened to the public reactions and decided which characters were the most in-need for costumes. We then started working on costumes for the most popular suggestions we have seen. Samus was of course one of those characters in dire need for costumes. After much discussion, we decided that we would only give her 3 different costumes for the next release. Making more than that would take more attention away from other characters that need costumes. Zero Suit Samus will, of course, get corresponding costumes.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>One of her costumes we decided on was the Light Suit. It is one of the more unique looking suits that she has, and we thought it fit in very well with the game. However, we had to make some modifications to the design in order for it to work with Project M.</p>

<p>Many of you who know the Metroid series will notice that the costume isn't as slim as the original design. We had to "buff" up the suit a bit, making the shoulder pads larger and the legs a bit thicker. This is to match the hitboxes and hurtboxes of the Brawl Samus model. As mentioned in the previous blog post explaining alternate costumes, we have to ensure that the costumes do not affect competitive play in any way. However, we were able to change the arm canon appearance to have the Metroid Prime design, as well as give it custom animations for her Final Smash and her beam-change taunt.</p>

<p><br /><br />

<br /></p>

<p>Our lead modeler for the Marth costume was Pik. We decided from the beginning that we are going to keep each costume the "same" character. Since the Fire Emblem series contains many memorable characters, we wanted to represent some of them in Project M. The art team talked, and decided to use Marth's alternate costume to represent a well known character from the series. We debated using his Awakening design at first, but in the end decided to go with Sigurd's armor.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com//content/images/news/altpost2/marth.png" /></center></p>

<p>Pik took inspiration from 18th century clothing, and used it in his design for the model. After many hours sketching and designing with Jiang, another member of the art team, Pik was able to come up with the final design for the costume.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com//content/images/news/altpost2/marthrender.png" /></center></p>

<p>Pik, along with FireBall Stars, also helped design the Classic Pit costume. We wanted to add a fun, goofy costume based on his NES appearance. We thought Project M's audience was in the older range, so we chose a nostalgic Kid Icarus costume. His classic design was used and transformed into a more modern appearance. It is like a "Toon Pit" in a way.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com//content/images/news/altpost2/pit.png" /></center></p>

<p>For Lucario's costume, we decided to give him a fighting Gi in the spirit of his new fighting style. Spex130 was the designer of the costume. At first we decided to use a classic Gi robe, but it seemed a bit plain to us. Spex experimented with many different color schemes for the Gi, but nothing really "popped" for us. Then he came up with the idea to use "hold items" found in the Pokemon games. The main costume uses the "Focus Band" and "Expert's Belt", with a fighter/steel type symbol on the back.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com//content/images/news/altpost2/lucario.png" /></center></p>

<p>After adding the items to the costume, we finalized the colors, and even created an extra single recolor to use.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com//content/images/news/altpost2/lucario2.png" /></center></p>

<p>Finally, we have the Ocarina of Time Ganondorf. He was by far our most wanted alternate costume from the community. Pik decided to take inspiration from Ganondorf's Melee design, as well as his Ocarina of Time design, and put them into one model. He, just like Link, was also given other model and texture edits for a more modern look.</p>

<p><center><img src="http://projectm.kfeavel.com//content/images/news/altpost2/ganon.png" /></center></p>

<p>These five costumes aren't the only ones we have been working on. We'll have plenty more costumes ready for the next release of Project M, as well as other small tweaks to costumes that were previously in 3.0. We just wanted to give you all a little preview of what's to come in that department -- look forward to more in the future!</p>
