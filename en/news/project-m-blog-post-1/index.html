				<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As many of you know, the Project M team has talked about the idea of a patch to remove some of the bugs found in the release build for some time now. We had kept that goal in mind for some time, but I'm pleased to announce that our patch will contain a lot more than just bug fixes. We have made some amazing discoveries in the past weeks, largely thanks to Magus' newfound ASM knowledge, and these changes will be included in the next patch.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As such, we will be having a series of posts containing some of the major discoveries we have made since our initial release. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for additional updates on many more of our discoveries!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1>Today's Segment: Directional Influence</h1>

<p>Yes everyone, we have finally fixed DI. For those of you who didn't know, Brawl DI had many flaws which do not fit well in a combo-oriented engine:</p>

<ul class="bulletlist">
<li>You could not DI any attack that did not send your character into the tumble state. This resulted in the numerous un-DIable chaingrabs and certain locks in Brawl</li>
<li>Control stick inputs for each axis max out 100% before reaching the edges of the controller, which allowed diagonal inputs to exceed the normal max distance of 1.00 found on the four cardinal directions. Since trajectory DI is based directly on the distance the stick is held perpendicularly to the default trajectory (18 degrees multiplied by that distance) this potential for a greater than 1 multiplier made unusually powerful DI possible on diagonal sending attacks with a change of up to 24 degrees, compared to the normal change of up to 18 on cardinal launching attacks</li>
<li>You could not DI attacks that were between -18 and +18 degrees from horizontal</li>
<li>You could not use ASDI, or Automatic Smash DI, downwards on a hit where you originated from the ground</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Every flaw on this list has been addressed with our new codes!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Nontumble DI is back, which means you can finally DI (and not just SDI) out of weak comboable attacks such as Sheik's tilts and much more.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Furthermore, DI potency has been corrected by scaling down stick distances greater than 1 so that the maximum DI potency is 18 degrees on all trajectories rather than being anywhere between 18 and 24 depending on how close it is to a diagonal, and since Melee and Brawl both use the same 18 degree constant for trajectory DI they also now match.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>See images below for former and current DI potency.</p>

</center></p>

<p>Additionally, you can DI any angle at which you are hit. There are no limitations within -18 to +18 from horizontal.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>And finally, you can now ASDI downwards on grounded hits. This last feature has reenabled our ability to code true melee crouch canceling.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates on that and much more!</p>
