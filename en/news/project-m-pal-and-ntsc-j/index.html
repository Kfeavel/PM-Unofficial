				<p>Hello guys, it's the PMDev Team. You haven't heard much from us in the last few months beyond member AMAs on Reddit, however, it doesn't mean that we’re not working hard on the game as always.<br />
<br /><br />
If you recall, as a part of the version 3.5 announcement, we announced that the highly anticipated port for PAL Wiis / Wii Us would arrive shortly after the release of 3.5.</p>

<p><center><br />

<p><em>PAL announcement in the 3.5 trailer.</em></p>

<p></center><br /></p>

<p>Now, more than four months after the release of 3.5, we can say that "shortly" is definitely not a word that we would use to describe the time that has passed. We are aware that there are many fans that have been waiting patiently to be able to play Project M in PAL territories without resorting to NTSC-U hardware. Out of respect to all of you, our dedicated fans, this blogpost intends to give an insight into how the development of the port is going.<br />
<br /><br />
First, we have to explain how the process works and differences between the NTSC and PAL versions.<br />
<br /><br />
NTSC-U, NTSC-J, and PAL all have differences in how the codes work and what addresses they use in the console's memory. PAL is the most different between them. NTSC-U and J each have only one language option, English and Japanese. PAL has many different languages available, which increases the number of text graphics, text files, and sound banks for certain characters and other voices, like the playable characters, Poké Ball Pokémon, and the announcer.<br />
<br /><br />
Beyond that, we face the problem that the majority of the PMDev Team members live in the NTSC-U territory. That said, they face the opposite issue as most of you. Because they have NTSC-U hardware, they are unable to boot the PAL version of the game to test the codes and/or changes to the game's files. This limits testing just to the people who are able to do so, thus tasking them with double the effort due to having to test any changes on NTSC as well. This severely slows down the process of debugging the port. It is safe to say that we have underestimated the resources needed to help with the PAL porting, such as the number of available playtesters.<br />
<br /><br />
The confidence of having PAL done not too long after 3.5 was released originated from having a skilled member joining specifically to work on the port. Unfortunately, life outside of Project M took a toll on him and he wasn't able to make as much progress as he expected or wanted. Our coders, standardtoaster and wiiztec, continued to work on the port and achieved a great deal of progress. However, they are unable to test the port extensively and, as such, progress stagnated.<br />
<br /><br />
One of our best coders, and our porter for the NTSC-J version, also became way too busy to continue working on the Japanese port. He was also assisting greatly with the PAL port.<br />
<br /><br />
Now that all of this has been said, we have both good and bad news regarding these region ports.<br />
<br /><br />
It is impossible for any of us to continue porting the game to NTSC-J without a skilled coder that knows the Japanese language. So, for now, no further versions of Project M will be ported to NTSC-J until we have the people necessary to do so.<br />
<br /><br />
For PAL, we have to declare that the port is not completed. Our coder, wiiztec, however, reported that it is not far from completion, although he is not completely aware of what kinds of hurdles the still non-ported files will bring to the table.<br />
<br /><br />
Now that we have detailed the issues we have encountered regarding these region ports, we ask for your understanding. As you already know, the PMDev Team is a group of volunteers, and we are a non-profit team. All of the work we do depends greatly on the free time available to our team members. That said, when important life issues come up, we have no choice but to accept them and take care of our lives first. We hope you all understand.<br />
<br /><br />
Whether the PAL port will be done shortly or not is something we are unable to ascertain to you with the clarity you deserve. We can only hope that this message will bring to us the people that can help us port the game faster and more efficiently.<br />
<br /><br />
