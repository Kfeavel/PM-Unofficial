				<hr />
				<p>Hello and welcome to the Project M 3.5 changelist! This is an extensive (but potentially not complete) log documenting the changes between Project M 3.02 and Project M 3.5. As usual, we prioritized getting the changelist out right when the version released, so in some cases it may not be 100% correct or formatted nicely. Please bear with us as we first off take a break from the monotony of changelog compilation, hoping .to return to this changelist and edit it for additional accuracy at a later date. Please understand that these changelogs were compiled by different people, and as such they may be worded differently. </p>

<p><br />With that out of the way, we're going to be using some technical terms that the community at large may not understand. To help with this changelog's effectiveness, we'll be defining these terms below.</p>

<p><br />DMG = Damage.<br />
<br />KB = Knockback<br />
<br />KBG = Knockback Growth. This value determines how quickly a hitbox's KB scales with the opponents percent. Damage is also a major factor in determining scaling.<br />
<br />BKB = Base Knockback. This amount of KB is added to the end result of the knockback formula and is most noticeable a low percents.<br />
<br />WDSK = Weight Dependent Set Knockback. As the name impies, this is a type of KB that is set and does not scale with percent, and instead has a set amount that varies only based on the opponents weight. KBG in this instance is used as a multiplier, but is usually set at 100.<br />
<br />IASA = Interruptible As Soon As. This is a long-standing term in competitive Smash that refers to the first frame that a character can interrupt an attack, often before the full animation has completed visually. Generally this will be used to describe endlag increases and decreases.<br />
<br />Hitlag = The amount of freeze frames a character goes into when hit by a hitbox. This term will usually be used to describe a multiplier that increases or decreases the amount of hitlag that a hitbox would normally induce.<br />
<br />SDI = Smash DI, the ability for a player to move around while in Hitlag based on control stick input. This term will usually be used to describe a multiplier that increases or decreases the effectiveness of SDIing an attack.<br />
<br />Angle/Trajectory = This describes the angle at which an opponent is sent flying after being hit by a hitbox. 90 is straight up, while 0 is a purely horizontal trajectory.<br />
361 angle = This angle is used throughout the game as a dynamic replacement to what would otherwise be 45, the go-to "horizontal attack" angle. This angle starts off sending further horizontally than 45 at lower KBs, but quickly scales up to 45 in-game. For all intents and purposes you can imagine the trajectory as simply being 45.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Now that we've explained those terms, here's the changelog!</p>

<div class="changelog toggle"><b>General Changelist</b>
<div class="collapse">
<br />-Debug Mode Added. Refer to the blogposts for more information.
<br />--Debug Mode Controls
<br />---(L+R->DPadDown) ---------- Debug Mode Toggle
<br />---(R->DPadRight) -------------- Hitbox, Hitstun, & Body Collision State ---Display Settings (OFF -> ON|No 'Interp' -> ON|'Interp')
<br />---(L->DPadLeft) ----------------- Camera Lock + HUD/Tag Disable Toggle
<br />---(Y->DPadRight) --------------- Ledge Grab Box Display Toggle
<br />---(Y->DPadLeft) ----------------- Collision Points (SCD) & TopN Display Toggle
<br />---(B->DPadLeft/Right) -------- Character Switcher (1x step)
<br />---(B+A->DPadLeft/Right) ---- Character Switcher (10x step)
<br />
<br />-All Star Versus added to Special Versus. Use a different character for each stock! Select your characters in the order you would like to use them.  Click on the Character Select Portrait to unpick them if you make a mistake. Note: in Doubles, team colors must be selected before selecting characters.
<br />-Stamina mode heavily updated to provide unique gameplay options as well as support for Stocks and up to 990%. Options include X/Y Wrap replacing blastzones and regular knockback scaling as opposed to the set knockback usually provided in Stamina mode.
<br />-Screen KOs re-enabled. Screen KOs and Star KOs animation length are now the same. 
<br />-Teams duplicate character is darker instead of lighter
<br />-In-game timer displays 10s digit of time even when under 10 minutes remain (displays as 08:00 for example)
<br />-Pause set to Off replaced by Hold feature. When this setting is used, the Start or + button must be held for 50 frames before the game will be paused
<br />-KO Star Count now keeps track of # of wins instead of KOs
<br />-Button inputs are now independent of each other, allowing you to for example press R while L is held.
<br />-A bug that caused all throws to release higher than they were supposed to was fixed
<br />-Actionable Invincibility granted upon grabbing the ledge is now zero (instead of 29) frames after 5 ledge grabs without landing on-stage
<br />-Can now ASDI while in shield. Shield pushback matched to Melee.
<br />-Name List (and other lists) on Character Select Screen scrolls by 5 if holding L or R 
<br />-Aerial Glide Toss (Air Dodge -> Item Throw) distance decays 10% in distance with each use.
<br />-Pressing Jump while in Wallcling will now Walljump instead of performing a Double Jump. 
<br />-Airdodge distance scaling matched to Super Smash Bros. Melee. This enables full-distance wavedashes more easily.

<br /><br />Global character changes
<br />-Boost Smash (aka DACUS) window is 2 frames for everyone. Boost Smash distance (or in some cases relevance) still primarily based on movement during startup frames of Dash Attack, with a few exceptions.
<br />-Footstools
<br />--Shielding characters can no longer be footstooled; footstooler will still jump up, but shielding opponent will remain in shield.
<br />--Footstool shorthop heights reduced.
<br />-Item throw speeds overall homogenized among the cast, with minor differences based on animation. Refer to the following chart (click for higher resolution): <br />
<br /> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9KlQBLQ.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9KlQBLQ.png" width="550px"></a>
<br />Order is grounded F/B/D/U throws, Dash Throw, then aerial F/B/D/U throws. In each, the data is Item Release/Total Animation Length in frames, with the character being able to act the frame afterward.
<br />-Slip attacks (get-up attacks performed after being tripped) invincibility made to last up until the first hitbox terminates. Frame 21 from 8 globally.
<br /><br />-Tethers
<br />--Tether Limit is 1 for Zairs and 2 for special tethers, previously 3 each, per airtime.
<br />--Can no longer cancel a Tether hold by pressing down.
<br />--When hogged, forced hop is now a 50 frame animation (from 29-40 depending on character), is fastfallable to land quicker. Goes into 30 frames special landing (from 4). Ability to drift during this hop lowered.
<br />--Some additional character-specific changes are noted in their respective changelogs, found below. </div> </div>

<div class="changelog toggle"><b>Zelda Changelist</b>
<div class="collapse">
<br /><br />Tilts
<br />-Forward Tilt: Tip angle 108->110 to match other upwards hitboxes. BKB/KBG adjusted. Hitbox terminates one frame earlier to trim excessive lingering. Hitlag/SDI modifiers now 1.0x.
<br />-Up Tilt: Damage 12->15 on early hit, 11->13 on late hit, KBG compensated. Late hit angle 92->85, begins when arm is around 1 o'clock position instead of behind.
<br />-Down Tilt: Damage 7/8 -> 10/11, KBG compensated. Simplified hitboxes to maintain same usage, but have less hitbox commands.

<br /><br />Smashes
<br />-Forward Smash: Hitlag multipliers 0x -> 0.7x, SDI multipliers 0x -> 0.25x
<br />-Up Smash: Endlag reduced by 1 frame, to match Melee IASA. Removed extra linking hit previously added to 2nd attack wave, which increased the damage. Now 16->15 damage. BKB reduced slightly, KBG increased to compensate. Angle 90-88. SDI multipliers (0.15, 0.2, 0.25) -> 0.25x
<br />-Down Smash: Removed pointless fully overlapped hitbox on foot, front hit terminates one frame earlier to not connect on opponents behind you and preventing the stronger back hit from hitting, or sometimes double hitting.

<br /><br />Aerials
<br />-Neutral Aerial: Landing hitbox vs grounded opponents WDSK 54-40 to induce a less erratic hitstun animation. SDI multipliers on outer hits 0.4x -> 0.5x.
<br />-Forward Aerial: Super sweetspot removed. Sweetspot damage 18(initial hit frame)/16(remaining hit window) -> 19/16. Overlapping flub hitbox on leg moved to cover hip.
<br />-Back Aerial: Super sweetspot removed. Sweetspot damage 17/15 -> 18/15. Overlapping flub hitbox on leg moved to cover hip.
<br />-Up Aerial: Electric flub hitbox angle 85->75, KBG 75-100, BKB 64-60. Hitlag multiplier on early hitbox 0.6 -> 1.0

<br /><br />Grabs
<br />-Standing Grab: Grabs on Frame 8 from 9. Active for 2 frame from 3. Grabboxes cleaned up.
<br />-Turn Grab: Grab duration reduced from 3->2 to match other turn grabs. Hitboxes cleaned up.
<br />-Pummel: Damage decreased from 4->3, but slightly faster.

<br /><br />Throws
<br />-Forward Throw: Release point is closer and lower to combo better. BKB 68->60, Damage decreased from 12->10, KBG compensated. Endlag uses added IASA and less drastic FSM to look more natural.
<br />-Up Throw: Damage decreased from 9-8, KB values compensated. Releases a frame faster.
<br />-Down Throw: Damage decreased from 15->14, KB values compensated.

<br /><br />Specials
<br />-Neutral Special (Nayru's Love): Character momentum resets properly. Cleaned up hitboxes so being hit by the edges of last hit has reversible KB, but being hit within the outer edges still sends the way Zelda is facing.
<br />--Grounded: Final hit angle 45/40 -> 361, BKB 55/50->50, KBG compensated. Startup reduced by 3 frames.
<br />--Aerial: Intangibility removed. Angle 60/55 -> 55, BKB 50/45 -> 45, KBG compensated. SDI 0.5x->0.8 on linking hits. Land cancel occurs slightly later and startup reduced by 3 frames for same total time.
<br />-Forward Special (Din's Fire): 
<br />--Proximity hitbox increased in size, does more damage to shields, damage increases with charge time, and initial uncharged size is larger. Time out explosion is slightly larger and does more damage. Startup reduced. Air IASA matches the faster ground IASA. When placing the Din's, it now begins fast and decelerates as it gets bigger.
<br />--Amount of Din's active on screen at one time decreased 3->1. Camera now tracks the Din's Fire and keeps it on screen.
<br />--While in play, performing Forward Special again will activate the Din's, causing a small explosion before heading on a return path back towards Zelda with a weak hitbox, and refreshing the hitbox if the Din's was already in motion. If the proximity hitbox hits, is shielded, or is clanked while stationary this will also cause it to return to her. The returning movement and turning speed is slower the more it is charged, with sufficient charge allowing for Zelda to avoid re-catching it immediately. If it does not reach Zelda after a few seconds, it will expire and disappear on its own without being re-caught.
<br />--If Zelda is hit/grabbed while it is in motion, it will unlink from her and travel in a straight line, unless she reactivates it (while linked a flashing red GFX on her hand is present). It will also not track Zelda or be re-caught and travel straight ahead if Zelda is invisible or KOed. If left stationary for a few seconds it will self detonate with a much larger and powerful explosion.
<br />-Up Special (Farore's Wind): Airdodge interrupt out of ground only teleport removed, replaced with a B press to cancel/shorten movement during ground or aerial teleport that preserves sliding momentum and is able to snap onto platforms even when passing upwards through them, similar to wavelanding.
<br />--Ground to ground Farore cancel has shortest ending animation, comparable to airdodge landing lag. Ground startup hitbox changed from 95 BKB/0 KBG -> 95 WDSK.
<br />--Aerial ending no longer halts vertical, allowing sliding up walls a bit after reappearing when teleporting upwards to edges. Aerial Farore FSM on ending removed, with air mobility beginning later to increase commitment to her original travel direction. Land lag from reappearing in air increased from 20->30. KB of non-cancelled reappearance hit Angle 60->50, KBG 46->120, BKB 100->45.
<br />-Down Special (Transform) Air IASA after switching 1->7 to match grounded. Gravity decreased from 0.04 -> 0.03 to offset the longer aerial IASA. Initiates Din's into strong/large self detonation on frame 21, which then explodes on frame 49 when she disappears.

<br /><br />Others 
<br />-Dash acceleration increased to match Melee acceleration to dash speed ratio. 
<br />-Airdodge and jumps' stage collision detection adjusted, improving wavelanding ability significantly. 
<br />--Air Dodge vulnerability and enabling of gravity/fastfall/mobility begins 10 frames sooner to match Melee.
<br />-Hitlag multiplier on UTaunt 0.25x -> 1.0x. 
<br />-Hitlag multiplier on Staunt 0.5x->1.0x. 
<br />-Jab Angle 55->361, hitbox size slightly decreased on last hit. SDI multiplier on final hit now 1.0x.
<br />-Dash Attack Angle 78->88. Late hit terminates 1 frame earlier when her arms are no longer in front. Travels across a slightly larger area while the strong hit is out. </div> </div>
