				<p>Hello everyone. Yesterday we went over what we predict the tether mechanics will look like for the next version. We wanted to give you a look at an example of a recovery that we're re-balancing for the next version in our first blogpost, but without the information on tether mechanics, we weren't able to give you the proper context. Now that you've got that, we can properly give you an in-depth evaluation of a recovery. Today’s subject matter is the beloved PK user from the Mother series: Lucas.<br />
<center><br />
<img src="http://projectmgame.com/content/images/news/lucas1.png" /><br />
</center><br />In the early days of Project M development there was a strong push to make Lucas feel unique compared to Ness. In particular, some of us thought that we could differentiate Lucas's offstage game by emphasizing his usage of Z-tether over his Up-Special, PK Thunder 2. Since then, Magnet -> Magnet -> Double Jump -> Air Dodge -> Tether has become his go-to recovery path. Most of the steps are flexible in timing and are quick enough to have relatively little commitment. He's protected by either his Magnet, Air Dodge, or rising aerials, and his <i>surprisingly</i> long-ranged tether quickly reels him in to a perfect sweetspot ledge grab. Additionally, canceling his Tether Hang allows Lucas to threaten the opponent with another quick Magnet, either stage spiking the edgeguarder or otherwise putting them into a disadvantageous position. Variations of this recovery path are so effective that Lucas can largely ignore PK Thunder 2. <br />
<center><br />
<img src="http://projectmgame.com/content/images/news/lucas1.jpg" /><br />
</center></br >As stated in the previous recovery blogpost, a major goal for us is to have characters creatively using all of their options while offstage. The new tether restrictions in place helped to tone down the Z-air recovery slightly, but it still didn't necessitate enough variation. We elected to match the Z-tether range closer to the physical range suggested by his turn grab (50 units -> 35 units). In addition to being more visually intuitive, it creates more scenarios where Lucas needs to utilize Up-Special to have enough range to recover. Z-tether is still an exceptionally powerful tool for both recovering and edgeguarding, but the combination of global tether adjustments and the shorter range of his tether means that it is no longer his best choice as consistently.<br />
<center><br />
<img src="http://projectmgame.com/content/images/news/lucas2.jpg" /><br />
</center><br />We've also adjusted Magnet's stalling capabilities. Most other stalls in the game, such as Marth Side-Special or Mario's Side-Special, lose the majority of their stalling efficacy immediately after the first aerial use. Conversely, Lucas could fire off quick blip after blip of Magnet with little reduction in stalling power. In this way he could wait out more edgeguarding attempts than many other characters, bypassing an inherent disadvantage of fast falling characters. We've now adjusted Magnet such that it no longer appreciably stalls Lucas’s fall speed after the first usage.<br />
<center><br />
<img src="http://projectmgame.com/content/images/news/lucas3.jpg" /><br />
</center><br />Finally, we've made some minor edits to PK Thunder 2 itself. We noticed that the hitboxes weren't working in game quite as predicted by our (admittedly, relatively rudimentary) development software, resulting in less protective disjoint than intended. We've now beefed these up slightly to give him a reasonable but not impenetrable disjoint while traveling. Additionally, we've adjusted the starting momentum and friction values to give it a much smoother, more natural feel overall. Lastly, we've slightly reduced the horizontal air drift control Lucas has after PK Thunder 2 ends -- many other moves which grant drift control so quickly after movement has ended also feature minor restrictions to special fall drift control.<br />
<center><br />

</center><br />
Our playtesting so far has demonstrated that these changes create a much more thoughtful, dynamic, and natural looking off-stage game for Lucas. He retains a hefty number of options to select from, but each option has been trimmed down just enough to put pressure on him to choose wisely. We feel that his recovery is now fitting for such an on-stage offensive powerhouse, and meets our stated design goals. Bear in mind that Lucas received more recovery changes than most cast members, and that some characters only required one or two simple tweaks.<br />
<br />So now that you've learned about our recovery criteria and have seen an example of our process, we hope you can now imagine what types of changes other members of the cast may receive. We have much left to share with you about the next version, but aren't quite ready to do so yet, so please be patient as we work on future blogposts. We hope to have two new ones out for you next week.<br/><br />
Until then,<br />
