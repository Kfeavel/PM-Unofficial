				<hr />
				<p>Hello Smashers, 3.0 release is officially upon us!</p>

<p><center><img src="http://projectmgame.com/content/images/news/3.0/Logo.png" /></center></p>

<h1>THE FULL ROSTER</h1>

<p>Fan favorites Roy, Mewtwo, Samus, Kirby, Yoshi, Ice-Climbers and Olimar all return in top form. With this landmark update not only completing the original Brawl roster, but expanding it to a massive 41 characters, we’ve chosen to shed the “DEMO” moniker from our title. However, please be aware that this is not yet Project M’s final or “gold” release – everything is still subject to refinement for now. </p>

<p><br /><br />
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tvESwcR.jpg" /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2QZgfdQ.jpg" /></center></p>

<h1>TURBO MODE</h1>

<p>This new release includes "Turbo Mode," a game type in Special VS which allows any character to interrupt moves once they’ve connected with an opponent. Chain attacks together to create Turbo speed combos limited only by your imagination and dexterity. Additionally, you can also gain short spurts of Turbo Mode within normal VS play by picking up the Turbo Curry item. Play it your way: mix it in to your normal item play or have fun in the full-time Turbo Mode. </p>

<p><br /><br />
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dO1vUl9.png" /></center></p>

<h1>ALTERNATE COSTUMES & COLORS</h1>

<p>But that's not all! This release also includes alternate costumes and colors for various characters. Please note that the current distribution of alternate costumes is not perfectly “balanced” or “fair,” -- we have limited modeling time and limited memory space, so we’ve tried to hit some of the costumes that we think will be the most popular first, and will continue adding costumes in future releases as time and space allow. Thanks for your understanding, and enjoy the first batch of costumes.</p>

<p><br /><br />
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DTM6CeM.jpg" /></center></p>

<h1>AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR 3-4 PLAYER FIGHTS</h1>

<p>There is one minor but important issue that we have to discuss for competitive play. Due to the slightly-flawed model importer that we have to use – which we are currently working on replacing – new models including Roy, Mewtwo, and all new alt costumes have a higher tendency to create gameplay lag than Brawl’s original models despite utilizing similar polygon counts. This is not an issue in singles play in most cases but in doubles more than two new player models on screen at once can potentially create noticeable lag. Again, this is something that we’re actively working on addressing, we'll have more details on the specific instances of lag for Tournament Operators to look at and make judgment calls on rules soon. We apologize for this inconvenience and hope to have this resolved in future releases. In the meantime, we have included warning icons on each costume's character portrait that has the potential to induce any amount of lag for players and TOs.</p>

<p><br /><br />
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZpwIWo1.jpg" /></center></p>

<h1>A CALL TO THE COMMUNITY</h1>

<p>Lastly, with the absolutely enormous amount of new characters, mechanics, features, costumes, and stages all added to 3.0 there will inevitably be bugs that we could not catch with our limited number of players. We need you, the community, to help us out by reporting the bugs you find on our <a href="http://smashboards.com/forums/bug-reporting.362/">Bug Reporting Forum</a>. The more specific you can be about how to reproduce a given bug the faster we can fix it. As with previous releases we will likely put out a “3.0b” or similarly named patch a few weeks after release squashing as many of the community-identified bugs as possible. Thanks for your understanding and your help.</p>

<p><br /><br />
<h1>GO GET IT!</h1><br />
There are plenty of fun surprises waiting to be discovered in 3.0 that we haven't revealed yet. So, what are you waiting for? <a href="download">Download it now</a>!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Enjoy,<br />
